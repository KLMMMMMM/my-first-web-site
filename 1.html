        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="web specifition" tab="_blank">World Wide Web (WWW or simply the Web)</a> is an information system that enables content sharing over the Internet through user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists and hobbyists.[1] 
        <br> It allows documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet according to specific rules of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).[2]
        <br>The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while at CERN in 1989 and opened to the public in 1991.It was conceived as a "universal linked information system".[3][4] 
        <br>Documents and other media content are made available to the network through web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. 
        <br>Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs).
        <br>The original and still very common document type is a web page formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). </p>
        <p><br>This markup language supports plain text, images, embedded video and audio contents, and scripts (short programs) that implement complex user interaction. 
        <br>The HTML language also supports hyperlinks (embedded URLs) which provide immediate access to other web resources. 
        <br>Web navigation, or web surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks across multiple websites.
        <br>Web applications are web pages that function as application software. The information in the Web is transferred across the Internet using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
        <br>Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain name make up a website. 
        <br> A single web server may provide multiple websites, while some websites, especially the most popular ones, may be provided by multiple servers. 
        <br>Website content is provided by a myriad of companies, organizations, government agencies, and individual users; and comprises an enormous amount of educational, entertainment, commercial, and government information.
        <br>The Web has become the world's dominant information systems platform.[5][6][7][8] It is the primary tool billions of people worldwide use to interact with the Internet.[9]
