    <p><a title="css specification" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1]
        <br>CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

        <br>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] 
        <br>This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .
        <br>css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
        
        <br> Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. 
        <br>CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]</p>
