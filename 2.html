        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HyperText Markup Language or HTML</a> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
        <br>It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        <br> Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
        <br> HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
        
        <br>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
        <br> HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. 
        <br> HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as * and * directly introduce content into the page. 
        <br> Other tags such as * and * surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. 
        <br> Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
        <br> HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. 
        <br>The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. 
        <br>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2]
        <br> A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the 
     element, together with JavaScript.
